Hello!
I am Chaitanya a 13 year old programmer and my project's 
name is SafeVault which keeps your passwords safe from attackers.
This password manager user python's AES-256 Encryption algorithm
from python's Cryptodome module.
This program has a no retrive policy if you forget your master
password, which is correct in a way because we hold your valuable
information and we cannot take chances.

This project was fun and learning.
I really really hope you like it I hope you will use it to your advantage.
Say bye bye to hackers!!
